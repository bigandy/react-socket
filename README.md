# React-socket

Using react, socket.io, and redis I have created a on-off light switch demo best viewed in two different browsers (can be on different devices). Click the on, and both will change to on using websockets.

I originally created this with jquery, socket.io and redis but I thought that State is a huge part of React and that this demo is using a light analogy which can only have two states - on or off - this would be a perfect place to start my React learning.
